# Sensor-Fusion-for-KITTI-dataset
This repository implements a multi-modal perception pipeline for autonomous driving, specifically designed for the KITTI Dataset. It provides a comparative analysis between Early Fusion (Data-Level) and Late Fusion (Result-Level) strategies, integrating 2D Camera vision with 3D LiDAR point clouds.
